This README file will be lacking for awhile. Stick around.

## More Information

@leeb1981 was bringing this plugin up-to-date so that it would work with e107v2. He is stumped and needs help. I'm placing this here so that others can attempt to contribute if they want. I will, when I get extra time, be doing what I can to help out to.

If you have any issues, please post them in the issue tracker so we can get them sorted ASAP.
