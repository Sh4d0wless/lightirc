This plugin is in the process of getting rewritten. Files will start to disappear from this repo shortly. Other files will be getting totally rewritten. If you have used this plugin in the past and want to see something included in the rewrite, please make a new issue in the issue tracker and I'll do my best to include it.

If you are interested in the old code, I've created a branch to house all of the code [here](https://github.com/septor/lightirc/tree/old-code). Please do not use this, it does not work correctly and will not be updated. It is posted for historical purposes only.

More information will be posted when I get it assembled.
