## NOTICE

This plugin is pending a complete rewrite. Upon investigating I've decided starting from scratch would be more beneficial. If you used this pluign in the past add your wishlist items to the issue tracker. I'll do my best to get them in. 

I'll be updating this README file with more information as I assemble it. Please note, my time is very limited so progress will be very sporadic.

This README file will be lacking for awhile. Stick around.

## More Information

@leeb1981 was bringing this plugin up-to-date so that it would work with e107v2. He is stumped and needs help. I'm placing this here so that others can attempt to contribute if they want. I will, when I get extra time, be doing what I can to help out to.

If you have any issues, please post them in the issue tracker so we can get them sorted ASAP.
